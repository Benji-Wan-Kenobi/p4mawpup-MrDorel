  2)Rename the file to "web".
  3)Right click on the file and click edit with notepad++.

    --MAKE SURE IT IS INDENTED EXACTLY AS IT IS HERE OR IT WILL NOT WORK--
    
import time
import urllib
import re



def main ():
	
	sec = 500
	timeT = 0

	while timeT < sec:
	
		print "Checking the current price of apple stock. This may take a few a few seconds..."
		time.sleep(5)
		htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/real-time")
		htmltext = htmlfile.read()
		regex = '<div id="qwidget_lastsale" class="qwidget-dollar">(.+?)</div>'	
		pattern = re.compile(regex)
		oldPrice = re.findall(pattern,htmltext)
		time.sleep(60)
		htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/real-time")
		htmltext = htmlfile.read()
		regex = '<div id="qwidget_lastsale" class="qwidget-dollar">(.+?)</div>'	
		pattern = re.compile(regex)
		newPrice = re.findall(pattern,htmltext)
		time.sleep(5)
		print " The current price of apple stock is: "
		print newPrice
		
		if newPrice != oldPrice:
			print "---------------------Price changed!---------------------"
			print "The new Apple stock price is:"
			oldPrice = newPrice
		
		else:
			print "The new Apple stock price is:"
			timeT +=1
			
		print newPrice
		
		if timeT < sec:
			print "Restarting...This may take a few seconds..."
		
		if timeT == sec:
			print "Ending process..."
		
		
	

main()





6) Exit and save the file, then rename the last bit called ".txt" to ".py" to convert the file type to python.

7)Open up cmd by clicking on the windows button in the bottom left corned of your screen. Type in cmd, right click on the cmd application that pops up anc click run as administrator.
The cmd app should pop up on your desktop and start running.

8)In cmd, type "cd desktop" then press enter, then type in "cd /pytoexe/.lpvenv/scripts" and press enter. Then type in "activate" and press enter. There should now be 
a "(.lpvenv)" before the text cmd now shows you. This means that cmd is running your virtual envirenment succesfully.

9) Type in "python web" and press enter. Cmd should start running your web scraper program. To end the process, press "ctrl" and "c".
