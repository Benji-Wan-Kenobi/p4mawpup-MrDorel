--To setup and run your web scraper, follow these steps:

  1)Create a new text file in your virtual envirenment folder, inside of the subfolder ".lpvenv".
  2)Rename the file to "web".
  3)Right click on the file and click edit with notepad++.
  4)Near the top left of the program notepad++ click "Language", click "P" and click "Python".
  5)Copy and paste the code below into your file, opened in notepad++:
    --MAKE SURE IT IS INDENTED EXACTLY AS IT IS HERE OR IT WILL NOT WORK--
    
import time
import urllib
import re



def main ():
	
	sec = 500
	timeT = 0

	while timeT < sec:
	
		print "Checking the current price of apple stock. This may take a few a few seconds..."
		time.sleep(5)
		htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/real-time")
		htmltext = htmlfile.read()
		regex = '<div id="qwidget_lastsale" class="qwidget-dollar">(.+?)</div>'	
		pattern = re.compile(regex)
		oldPrice = re.findall(pattern,htmltext)
		time.sleep(60)
		htmlfile = urllib.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/real-time")
		htmltext = htmlfile.read()
		regex = '<div id="qwidget_lastsale" class="qwidget-dollar">(.+?)</div>'	
		pattern = re.compile(regex)
		newPrice = re.findall(pattern,htmltext)
		time.sleep(5)
		print " The current price of apple stock is: "
		print newPrice
		
		if newPrice != oldPrice:
			print "---------------------Price changed!---------------------"
			print "The new Apple stock price is:"
			oldPrice = newPrice
		
		else:
			print "The new Apple stock price is:"
			timeT +=1
			
		print newPrice
		
		if timeT < sec:
			print "Restarting...This may take a few seconds..."
		
		if timeT == sec:
			print "Ending process..."
		
		
	

main()





6) Exit and save the file, then rename the last bit called ".txt" to ".py" to convert the file type to python.

7)Open up cmd by pressing the "windows button" and "r" together. a pop up will appear near the bottom left corner of your screen. 
Type in cmd into the "open" tab. Press enter. Cmd should pop up on your screen.

8)In cmd, type "cd desktop" then press enter, then type in "cd /pytoexe/.lpvenv/scripts" and press enter. Then type in "activate" and press enter. There should now be 
a "(.lpvenv)" before the text cmd now shows you. This means that cmd is running your virtual envirenment succesfully.

9) Type in "python web" and press enter. Cmd should start running your web scraper program. To end the process, press "ctrl" and "c".
