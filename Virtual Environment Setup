--To set up your virtual environment, follow these steps:
  1) Create a new text file on your desktop.
  
  2) Inside of that text file, copy and past the text below:
     --MAKE SURE IT IS INDENTED AS PRESENTED BELOW
 
      @echo off
      set myvar=%cd%
      :choice
      set /P  input=Do you want to make the folder in the current directory? "%myvar%" (Y/N)
      If /I "%input%"=="y" goto yes 
      If /I "%input%"=="n" goto no
      goto :choice

      :yes
      set myvar=%cd%
      set /p FolderName=Folder name (no spaces):
      mkdir %FolderName%
      cd %myvar%\%FolderName%
      c:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv -p c:\Python27\python.exe .lpvenv
      .lpvenv\Scripts\activate
      @echo on

      :no
      set /p dirname=%cd%\
      cd %cd%\%dirname%
      goto :yes

  3) Exit and save the text file, then right click on it and click rename to rename it. The specific thing you will be renaming is the file 
  type. Right now it has a ".txt" at the end of the file name. Rename the ".txt" to ".bat". Exclude the quotation marks. Now press enter and
  a pop-up should appear on your desktop. It will say "If you change the file name extension, the file might become unusable. Are you sure 
  you want to change it?". Click yes. Now check the end of the file name and make sure it has a ".bat" at the end of it. You should also 
  notice that the icon of the file has changed to an icon with gears on it. This is what you want, this is what a ".bat" file looks like.
  
  4) Double click the batch file you had just renamed. A windows cmd tab should pop up asking " Do you want to make the folder in the 
  current directory?". Type in "y" and press enter. Now the cmd should display "Folder name (no spaces):". Enter the name you want to call
  the virtual envirenment folder, without any spaces. Now the cmd will start the process of creating your folder. It should only take a few
  seconds, depending on your machine. after the process is done, cmd should automatically exit itself. If not, exit the cmd manually.
  
  5) You should be able to see your folder on the dektop. Double click it, and you will find another folder inside calle ".lpvenv". 
  Double click the ".lpvenv" folder and you should find four more folders "Include, Lib, Scripts, tcl" and a "pip-selfcheck.json" file.
  
  Your Virtual environment is now set up in a folder on your desktop.
